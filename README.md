# videosdk-react-native-pip-mode-example

## Overview

Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode allows users to continue a video call while using other apps. This feature is useful for multitasking, such as taking notes or browsing the web during a call.

## Setup Guide

- Sign up on [VideoSDK](https://www.videosdk.live/) and visit the [API Keys](https://app.videosdk.live/api-keys) section to get your API key and Secret key.
- Get familiarized with [Token](https://docs.videosdk.live/flutter/guide/video-and-audio-calling-api-sdk/authentication-and-tokens).

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have:

- Node.js â‰¥ 14.x
- React Native CLI
- Valid [VideoSDK Account](https://app.videosdk.live/signup)

## Installation & Setup

cd videosdk-react-native-pip-mode-example
```

```

- Add VideoSDK Token

Update the token in the api.js file:

## PiP Mode Usage

1. Launch the app on your device.
2. Start a video call using the built-in UI.
3. PiP mode activates automatically when you press the PiP button or send the app to the background.
4. The video will shrink into a floating window, allowing you to multitask while keeping the call visible.
5. Returning to the app will exit PiP mode and restore the full-screen view.
